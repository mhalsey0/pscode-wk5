// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Input a number
If remainder of number divided by 2 >0 then print Odd
Else print Even

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


Ask for a number 5 times and store in list
Average = Add all numbers together and divide by 5
Min = minimum of list
Max = maximum of list
Print "The list average is `average`, the smallest number is `min`, and the largest number is `Max`
